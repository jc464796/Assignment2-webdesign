<h2>Goals</h2>
<div><ol>

	<li>To encorage the performers to letus host their concerts</li>
	<li>To recruit new members for the TCMC</li>
	<li>To encorage people for volunteering for the TCMC</li>
	</ol></div>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<div> <ol>
	<li>To increase the sales of the tickets we have
	designed in such a way that people will know every thing that is going on within the TCMC i.e, the new events will be displayed in the home page and will be directed to the events page for other events.</li>
	<li>A subscribe button is presented at the end of the page for the people to get real time notifications of all the events that are going on in TCMC.</li>
	<li>To Recruit new members for the TCMC the members application form is made online so that every member can signup online.</li>
	<li>We have given the Artists a seperate page and the image slilder in the home page will show the artists image and link them in to the artists page.</li>
	<li>The theater page is created showing all the aspects of the theatre.</li>
	<li>So due to the above two reasons i.e, the intence advertisements and the theatre aspects the artists may be inclined to let us host their concerts.</li>
	<li>We have created the Website in such a way that the people will find it attractive and easy to access.</li>
	</ol></div>
